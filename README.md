# Joint Geometric and Topological Analysis of Hierarchical Datasets
## Paper Code

This repository contains the code for the paper: Joint Geometric and Topological Analysis of Hierarchical Datasets.

### Simulation:
In order to run simulation experiments run the file:

```Simulation_run.py```

### HSI Application:
First, download the HSI images in this [link](http://xlim-sic.labo.univ-poitiers.fr/datasets/ICONES-HSI) to the sub-folder  ```/ICONES_Data/ICONES-HSI```.

In order to run HSI experiments run the file:

```HSI_run.py```

### Folders
#### Geometric
Alternating Diffusion code and manifold learning functions can be found at ```Geometric```.

#### Topological
Persistence Homology code can be found at ```TDA```.
